# Godot-RSS
  	
   A plugin for Godot that parses and displays RSS feeds in engine (and editor).
   
   NOTE: This plugin currently only supports RSS feeds and not ATOM feeds.
   
   NOTE: This plugin includes the GodotXML addon, which is a dependency for this plugin to work. The GodotXML plugin is not orignally created by me and was taken from [here](https://github.com/elenakrittik/GodotXML).
